# Predator-Prey-Simulation
This program simulates a predator-prey situation where prey are ants and the predators are doodlebugs. The world in which the creatures live is a 20 by 20 grid; each cell of the grid can either be empty or contain a single creature. The creatures are not allowed to move outside the grid. Time is simulated in steps in a loop and each creature moves, breeds, and dies (and eats).
